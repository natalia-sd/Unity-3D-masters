This game was First Semester's Project dedicated to learning Unity Basics.

We have developed a cozy and colorful mini puzzle game called NEON DREAM full of glowing neon-ish vibes inspired by cyberpunk, Love.Death+Robots and asian aesthetics.

You are to solve two puzzles to find the way out of strangily stupefying world of your dream. If you succeed you can come back home.... or not? Whatever, it is up to you to decide if it was a dream or not and whether you want to be back
